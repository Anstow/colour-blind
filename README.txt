Colour Blind: a game made in 48 hours by David Watson, David Walton and Joseph
Lansdowne, for the theme 'blindfolded players'.

This is a 2-player co-operative game; play using WASD and the arrow keys,
where S/down toggle switches, and press R to reset the current level.  WASD and
R are also in the same place for the Dvorak keyboard layout.

There's a level editor you can play around with: F2 to toggle it, ctrl to show
the available things, mouse to do stuff with the things. Click on a switch then
a wall to link them.
