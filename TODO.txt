This is a todo list for the game. If anyone else is working on it that is.

Bugs:

1 Switch editing doesn't work:
Make the editor work again in the new way

Features:

2 Remove deprecated wall code, we'll only every needed it if we decide that the new way isn't good, in which case well need to make a lot of changes

3 Update the levels to contain the logicBlock statement, this should be a simple matter of loading the level and resaving it. (Perhaps checking they still work would be useful)

5 Add a title screen.

6 Add a level select (we should probably think about a way of naming the levels).

7 Add a restart button (I don't think this is done yet)

8 Add a disable music/sound button

9 Implement timing, should be doable using the LogicBlock class 

10 Graphics
	make mouths less wide?

blindfolds

pressure pads

inverted switches

Done:

4 Change the wall toggling to be contained in a new class called an event, (this should let us do more stuff, I hope)
