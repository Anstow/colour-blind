This is a todo list for the game. If anyone else is working on it that is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs:

adding or removing switches in the editor when a switch already exists causes an error
this is due to the addTxt and rmTxt numbering system.

multiple targets can be added in the editor
this is a feature, you asked me to put it in towards the end of the 48 hour competition

18 Hitting a both targets at the same time doesn't move the level on

moving within affect blocks should probably be down = right, left = up (seems to be the other way round now)

make the event box background (the blue and grey bit) stretch across the whole screen

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features:

add move obvious way of removing a logic block 

improve title screen (its a little rubbish at the moment, I'm [David Watson] currently working on this)

6 Add a level select (we should probably think about a way of naming the levels).

9 Implement timing, should be doable using the LogicBlock class 

10 Graphics
	make mouths less wide?
	improve lava sprite (perhaps use a sprite map to animate it)

11 blindfolds

12 pressure pads

13 Editor copy facility

14 Editor multisubsection affect adding

15 Add description text to levels.

16 display links between swtiches and walls

17 implement a vrs mode

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Done:

4 Change the wall toggling to be contained in a new class called an event, (this should let us do more stuff, I hope)

short jump followed by immediate full jump is higher than 4 tiles

Add a restart button (I don't think this is done yet)

draw numbers on walls and switches in the editor

8 Add a disable music/sound button

2 Remove deprecated wall code, we'll only every needed it if we decide that the new way isn't good, in which case well need to make a lot of changes (I think this is done now).

1 Switch editing doesn't work:
Make the editor work again in the new way

3 Update the levels to contain the logicBlock statement, this should be a simple matter of loading the level and resaving it. (Perhaps checking they still work would be useful) and re-linking them.

5 Add a title screen. 

can't seem to enter 'WTI' in an affect block
